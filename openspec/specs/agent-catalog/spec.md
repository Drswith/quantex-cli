# agent-catalog Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change remove-agent-description-metadata. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Supported agent catalog entries MUST stay lifecycle-focused

Quantex SHALL keep supported agent catalog metadata scoped to values that directly support installation, inspection, resolution, execution, update planning, and stable machine-readable contracts.

#### Scenario: Registering a supported agent entry

- **WHEN** Quantex defines or updates a supported agent entry
- **THEN** the entry includes only metadata that is relevant to lifecycle operations or stable identification
- **AND** that metadata may include canonical name, display name, lookup aliases, homepage, package metadata, install methods, binary name, version probe data, and self-update commands
- **AND** Quantex does not require free-form descriptive marketing copy as part of the catalog contract

### Requirement: Lifecycle inspection surfaces MUST avoid localized descriptive metadata

Quantex lifecycle inspection surfaces SHALL expose stable agent identifiers and lifecycle metadata without requiring localized prose fields.

#### Scenario: Rendering or returning agent metadata

- **GIVEN** the user runs `quantex info <agent>` or `quantex inspect <agent>`
- **WHEN** Quantex returns human-readable or structured agent metadata
- **THEN** the result includes the identifiers and lifecycle fields needed to install, inspect, or update the agent
- **AND** the result does not depend on a free-form `description` field to remain valid
